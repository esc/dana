Reporting Bugs
==============

Bug report to DANA itself should be submitted via the `DANA Bug Tracker
<https://gforge.inria.fr/tracker/?group_id=628>`_. The first step before filing
a report is to determine whether the problem has already been reported. If the
problem youâ€™re reporting is not already, please file a bug report with a
precise description of the problem and a minimal example exhibiting the problem.
