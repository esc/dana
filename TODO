* Add circular option for connection (might be difficult for dense and sparse)
* Add FFT convolution for shared connections when kernel is badly separable
* Allow shared connections even when src and dst are not the same size
   (use scipy.ndimage.interpolation.zoom)
* Make sparse and dense kernel building much faster (no idea how yet)
