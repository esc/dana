* Add circular option for connection (might be difficult for dense and sparse)
    -> done for dense and sparse

* Add FFT convolution for shared connections when kernel is badly separable

* Allow shared connections even when src and dst are not the same size
   (use scipy.ndimage.interpolation.zoom)

* Make sparse and dense kernel building much faster (no idea how yet)
   -> done (see convolution_matrix)

* Implement Monitor objects to monitior various activities

* Implement Network operators that can be called anytime
  => @every(dt)
  => @random(dt)
