Complete guide
===============

You should read this guide if you intent to develop models using the DANA
computing framework and especially if your models belong to the computational
neuroscience domain. DANA is a python library and depends heavily on external
library such as numpy and scipy. However, this guide does not provide a
tutorial to the python language neither an introduction to the numpy/scipy
libraries. If you're unfamiliar with both of them, you'encouraged to document
yourself first by considering external resources for both python, numpy and
scipy.

Quick start
===========

Getting started with a new library or framework can be daunting, especially
when presented with a large amount of reference material to read. This chapter
gives a very quick introduction to dana without covering any of the details.

A `quickstart <doc/quickstart.html>`_ to dana for the impatients.


API Reference
=============

Most of the application programming inteface can be read directly from a
terminal session::

    $ pydoc dana.Group

or from within a python/ipython session::

    >>> import dana
    >>> help(dana.Group)

This chapter is only a direct transcription of these documentation.

Application programming interface available from `here <doc/api.html>`_.
