===========================
While dana is targetted towards computational neuroscience, the generic
framework might be suitable for some other domains as well as illustrated on

====================
Dana depends only on python_ and numpy_. However, optional libraries such as
matplotlib_ or glumpy_ or tools like ipython_ might be useful as well.
