dana is based on vectorized computation, this means that the building block of a
model it not a neuron alone but a group of similar neurons organized
topologically. Vectorized computations are carried out using the `numpy
<http:/www.numpy.org>`_ scientific package thay offers a powerful N-dimensional
array object as well as sophisticated (broadcasting) functions. Further numpy
information can be obtained from:

    * `NumPy and SciPy documentation page <http://www.scipy.org/Installing_SciPy>`_
    * `NumPy Tutorial <http://www.scipy.org/Tentative_NumPy_Tutorial>`_
    * `NumPy functions by category <http://www.scipy.org/Numpy_Functions_by_Category>`_
