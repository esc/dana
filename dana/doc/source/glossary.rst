   **group**
      A  group  represents a  matrix  of homogeneous  units  that  can have  an
      arbitrary number of values whose name and type must be described at group
      creation.  These values  can be  later accessed  using  either dictionary
      lookups such as ``group['x']``  and ``group['y']`` or accessed as members
      using ``group.x`` and ``group.y``.
