.. title:: DANA

DANA is a python computing framework for distributed asynchronous numerical
computing. The computational paradigm supporting the framework is grounded on
the notion of a group of units that is essentially a set of arbitrary values
that can vary along time under the influence of other groups and learning.
Each group can be linked to any other group (including itself) using a weighted
link.  DANA framework offers a set of core objects needed to design and run
such networks. However, what is actually computed by a group and what is
learned is the responsibility of the modeler who is in charge of describing the
equation governing the behavior of the groups over time.
