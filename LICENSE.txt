DANA is a python computing framework based on numpy and scipy libraries.

The computational  paradigm supporting  the DANA framework  is grounded  on the
notion of  a unit that is  a set of arbitrary  values that can  vary along time
under the influence of other units and learning. Each unit can be linked to any
other unit (including itself) using a weighted link and a group is a structured
set of such homogeneous units. The  dana framework offers a set of core objects
needed to design  and run such models. However, what is  actually computed by a
unit and what is learned is the  responsibility of the modeler who is in charge
of describing  the equation  governing the behavior  of units groups  over time
and/or learning.
